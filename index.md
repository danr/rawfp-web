# RAW FP
## Resource Aware Functional Programming

<!--[RAW FP](background.html) is a research project at [Chalmers University of
Technology](http://www.chalmers.se), where cutting edge functional programming research such
as [DSLs](dsl.html) solves practical real-world problems in our two tracks: the [telecom
industry](telecom.html) and the [automobile industry](automotive.html).-->

The goal of the [RAW FP](background.html) research project is to develop [domain specific embedded languages](dsl.html) for resource-aware functional programming, with associated end-to-end tool chains, that can deliver an order of magnitude improved productivity in two main domains of importance to Swedish industry:

 * [Signal processing](telecom.html) and low-level control in products such as radio base stations,
 * Real-time [automotive software](automotive.html) built around the AUTOSAR standard.

The project is funded by the [Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research](http://www.stratresearch.se/en/).
The project will run until September 2016. Contact us if you would like to be a visitor to the project!
