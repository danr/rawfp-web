# RAW FP
## Resource Aware Functional Programming

The goal of the [RAW FP](background.html) research project is to develop [domain specific embedded languages](dsl.html) for resource-aware functional programming, with associated end-to-end tool chains, that can deliver an order of magnitude improved productivity in two main domains of importance to Swedish industry:

 * [Signal processing](telecom.html) and low-level control in products such as radio base stations,
 * Real-time [automotive software](automotive.html) built around the AUTOSAR standard.

[RAW FP](background.html) is a research project in the Functional Programming Group at [Chalmers University of Technology](http://www.chalmers.se/cse).
The [project](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ms/SSF10Final.pdf) is funded by the [Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research](http://www.stratresearch.se/en/).
The project will run until September 2016. Contact us if you would like to be a visitor to the project!
